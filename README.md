# r_politics-project
This project is aimed at cleaning, analyzing and modelling the commentary data obtained from the /r/politics subreddit of reddit.  The main idea is to see if there is a correlation between variables of the comments and the score that the comment obtains.

# Datasets
The datasets are of the comments and posts made for October 2018 and are obtained from Google BigQuery courtesy of u/Stuck_In_The_Matrix from the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/.

The BigQuery webpage for the "politics_comments.csv" dataset is from: https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2018_10

The BigQuery webpage for the "politics_posts.csv" dataset is from: https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/fh-bigquery:reddit_posts.2018_10

# Data Cleaning
The datasets "politics_comments.csv" and "politics_posts.csv" are cleaned and merged into a dataset named "cleaned_r_politics.csv".  The notebook for cleaning it can be found here: https://github.com/JonathanHung95/r_politics-project/blob/master/r_politics%20Data%20Cleaning.ipynb

# Exploratory Data Analysis
To be done.
